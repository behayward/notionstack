    "overview": "The Cleaning Schedule & Household Tracker brings structure and accountability to home maintenance tasks that are easy to forget or procrastinate. This Notion template provides two versions: a focused cleaning schedule for quick implementation and a comprehensive household tracker that includes meal planning, shopping lists, and recipe management. With 40 pre-loaded cleaning tasks covering everything from daily tidying to seasonal deep-cleaning, this template ensures nothing falls through the cracks. Designed for both small apartments and large family homes, the customizable task system adapts to your household size, room count, and cleaning preferences. The clean aesthetic works in both light and dark mode, making it a pleasant part of your daily routine rather than a chore to use.",
