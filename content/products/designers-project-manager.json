    "overview": "The Designers Project Manager template is a focused, purpose-built system specifically crafted for the unique workflow of design professionals. Unlike generic project management tools that force designers to adapt their creative process to rigid business frameworks, this template understands the iterative, deadline-driven nature of design work and provides exactly what designers need without unnecessary complexity.\n\nAt its core, this template delivers a dual-system approach: comprehensive project management for tracking multiple design engagements alongside granular task management for daily execution. Whether you're juggling client projects, personal portfolio work, or collaborative design initiatives, this free template provides the organizational structure to meet deadlines while maintaining creative flow. The customizable workflows mean you can adapt the system to match your specific design discipline - whether that's UX/UI, graphic design, branding, or any other creative field.",
