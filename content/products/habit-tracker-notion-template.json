    "overview": "This Habit Tracker provides a soothing, visual approach to building lasting habits through daily tracking and weekly accountability. Rather than complex habit-stacking systems or overwhelming productivity frameworks, this template focuses on the simple but powerful practice of checking boxes daily until new behaviors become automatic.\n\nThe template's strength lies in its weekly review system - you track daily completion throughout the week, then add completed weeks to an ongoing tally that shows your long-term consistency. This approach helps you identify where you excel and where you struggle, making it easy to spot patterns and adjust your habits accordingly. With pre-built morning and evening routine sections plus unlimited custom habit slots, you can track everything from meditation to exercise to creative practices in one calming, organized space.",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How does the weekly tally system work?",
        "answer": "Each week, you check off your habits daily. At the end of the week, if you've completed all 7 days for a habit, you add it to that habit's weekly tally. This gives you a clear count of how many full weeks you've completed for each habit, providing powerful long-term motivation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I track habits that aren't daily, like 3 times per week?",
        "answer": "The template is designed for daily habits, with a checkbox for each day of the week. For habits with different frequencies, you could customize the template or simply check boxes on the days you plan to do the habit, though it works best for daily consistency tracking."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's included in the morning and evening routine sections?",
        "answer": "The template comes with pre-made morning and evening routine sections where you can add your specific habits. These might include things like meditation, journaling, exercise for morning, or reading, planning, and reflection for evening - fully customizable to your routines."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many habits can I track at once?",
        "answer": "You can add as many habits as you like to the template. However, for best results with habit formation, it's generally recommended to focus on 5-10 key habits rather than overwhelming yourself with too many simultaneous changes."
