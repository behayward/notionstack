    "overview": "Journal is a beautifully simple personal diary system built entirely in Notion, designed to capture your thoughts, memories, and experiences across different areas of your life. Unlike traditional single-purpose journals, this template lets you create unlimited separate journals for different purposes—one for daily reflections, another for your fitness journey, another for travel adventures. The standout feature is the 'On This Day' functionality that surfaces entries from past years, creating those magical moments when you rediscover forgotten memories. With unlimited entry capacity on Notion's free plan and an intuitive interface, this template removes all barriers between you and the transformative practice of journaling.",
