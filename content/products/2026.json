    "overview": "The 2026 Annual Planning Time Management System solves the perennial problem of abandoned New Year's goals by providing a complete framework that bridges the gap between annual aspirations and daily actions. This isn't just another goal-setting template—it's a systematic approach built on 'begin with the end in mind' and continuous feedback loops. By analyzing your past behavior patterns, the template helps you create a realistic 2026 plan tailored to who you actually are, not who you wish you were. The automated system selects and displays data for each quarter, month, week, and day, ensuring your big-picture goals remain visible while you execute the small actions that compound into transformation. If your goals typically fade by February, this template provides the ongoing structure and accountability to make 2026 different.",
