        "answer": "Absolutely. The language-based view is specifically designed for developers working across multiple languages. You can easily filter to see all your JavaScript snippets, Python functions, SQL queries, or any other language, while the category view lets you find snippets by purpose regardless of language."

        "question": "How do I add my first snippet to the tracker?",
        "answer": "Simply duplicate the template to your Notion workspace, then create a new entry in the snippets database. Add your code, select the programming language from the dropdown, choose or create a category, add any notes or reference URLs, and save. The dual views will automatically organize it for easy retrieval later."
