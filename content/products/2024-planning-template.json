    "overview": "The 2024 Planning Template is a comprehensive year-planning system created by a successful online entrepreneur who has used these exact methods to build a six-figure income. This template goes beyond simple goal-setting to help you create a complete vision for your year, calculate what your dream life actually costs, and build practical systems to achieve it. The template combines vision work with tactical execution, including a time audit feature that reveals where you're actually spending your hours versus where you want to spend them. Created by Anna, a web designer and content creator, this template reflects the real-world planning methods that produce results, not just aspirational goal-setting that never gets executed.",
