    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Isn't it impersonal to systematize relationships?",
        "answer": "Actually, the opposite is true. This system ensures you stay meaningfully connected with people who matter to you. The system handles the 'when' so you can focus on the 'how'—having genuine, thoughtful conversations rather than realizing six months later you haven't spoken to someone important. It's a tool for intentionality, not replacement for authentic connection."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I decide what frequency to assign to each person?",
        "answer": "Consider your relationship type and what feels sustainable. Close friends might be weekly or bi-weekly, family monthly, acquaintances quarterly, and professional contacts semi-annually. The beauty is you can adjust frequencies as relationships evolve. Start with your gut feeling and refine over time based on what actually works."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the automatic next-contact-date generation actually do?",
        "answer": "When you log that you contacted someone, the system automatically calculates and sets the next recommended contact date based on the frequency you've assigned to that relationship. For example, if you set someone to 'monthly' and log contact on January 15th, the system will automatically set the next date to February 15th and remind you when it's approaching."

      {
        "question": "Can I get coaching to use this template effectively?",
        "answer": "Yes, the creator offers optional 30-minute coaching calls to help you get the most out of the template. This can be particularly helpful if you're new to systematic relationship management or want personalized guidance on setting up your CRM to match your specific relationship ecosystem."
