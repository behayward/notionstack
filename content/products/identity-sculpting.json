        "question": "How do I get started with Identity Sculpting?",
        "answer": "Duplicate the template to your Notion workspace after purchase. Set aside dedicated time for deep reflection—this isn't a quick exercise. Work through each section sequentially: start with vision and mission, move through values and behaviors, complete the SWOT analysis, then finish with bucket list and fears. Take breaks between sections to let insights settle before continuing."

      {
        "question": "What's included in this planner?",

This is one template from a collection of 5 printable and digital planners."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize this for my personal growth journey?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! While the core frameworks (vision, mission, SWOT, values) provide proven structure, you can add custom reflection questions, adjust the depth of each section based on your needs, integrate with other goal-setting systems, expand areas that resonate most with you, and revisit and revise your responses as you evolve. The template works in both Notion and as a printable, giving you format flexibility."
