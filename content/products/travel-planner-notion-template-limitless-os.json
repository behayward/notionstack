    "overview": "Travel Planner is a specialized mini-template extracted from the comprehensive Limitless OS 3.0 system by Daniel Marthi. While it's part of a larger productivity ecosystem, this standalone template focuses exclusively on travel planning and vacation management, making it perfect for users who want robust trip organization without the full Limitless OS suite.\n\nThe template provides a complete travel planning workflow, from initial trip creation through flight booking, accommodation arrangements, activity brainstorming, and detailed itinerary building. Everything is tied together in a unified database that keeps all your travel information organized and accessible in one place.\n\nWith 537 sales and proven popularity, this free template has helped countless travelers transition from scattered travel documents and email confirmations to a centralized, organized travel planning system. It's particularly valuable for frequent travelers, travel planners who manage multiple upcoming trips, and anyone who wants more structure in their vacation planning process.",
