    "overview": "Brain Dump (Anime) is a lightweight mental decluttering system designed with an anime-inspired aesthetic that makes organizing your thoughts feel less like work and more like fun. This template provides four dedicated spaces to externalize everything swirling around in your mind: reminders for things you can't forget, quick notes for fleeting ideas, important tasks that need action, and even a space for useless thoughts that don't need to take up mental real estate. Each component is powered by its own Notion database, giving you the flexibility to capture, categorize, and clear your mind throughout the day. The anime theme adds visual appeal while the functional design ensures your brain dump actually helps you think more clearly and stress less.",
