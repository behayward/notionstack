    "overview": "Turn your aspirations into achievable milestones with this streamlined Goal Planner from Easlo Academy. This free Notion template provides a clean, focused framework for planning and tracking goals across multiple time horizons—weekly, quarterly, and yearly. Unlike overwhelming goal-setting systems that become abandoned projects themselves, this planner keeps things simple and actionable, helping you maintain momentum and make consistent progress toward what matters most.\n\nThe template recognizes that effective goal achievement requires both big-picture vision and granular weekly action. By integrating all time scales into one cohesive system, you can set ambitious yearly objectives, break them into manageable quarterly milestones, and then translate those milestones into weekly action items you can actually complete. This multi-level structure ensures your daily efforts align with your long-term vision, preventing the common problem of staying busy without making real progress.\n\nWhat makes this Goal Planner particularly accessible is its device flexibility and zero-cost barrier. Access your goals from your phone during commutes, review progress on your iPad during weekly planning sessions, or do deep quarterly reviews on your computer. The free template works perfectly on Notion's free tier, making professional goal planning available to anyone committed to personal or professional growth without requiring financial investment.",
