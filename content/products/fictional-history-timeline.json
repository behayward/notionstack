    "overview": "Bring order to complex fictional timelines with this specialized Notion template designed for worldbuilders and storytellers. The Fictional History Timeline helps writers create chronological maps of their story worlds, tracking events, characters, and locations across time periods with precision and clarity. Born from the challenge of understanding intricate narratives like the TV series LOST, this template transforms tangled plot threads into organized, visual timelines.\n\nWhether you're writing a novel, developing a TV series, creating a tabletop RPG campaign, or building a video game world, managing historical events across multiple timelines and character perspectives can quickly become overwhelming. This template provides dedicated databases and views that let you see your fictional history from different angles—by character, by location, by time period, or by storyline. It's particularly powerful for stories with non-linear narratives, flashbacks, parallel timelines, or centuries-spanning histories.\n\nThe template combines simplicity with depth, offering enough structure to keep complex timelines organized while remaining flexible enough to adapt to any genre or story type. Writers can track cause-and-effect relationships between events, ensure character ages align with plot developments, and identify gaps or inconsistencies in their worldbuilding before they become problems in the manuscript.",
