  "description": "In 2021 I grew my Twitter following from ~500 to over 4500 (and now up to 15k) and crafted over 1500 tweets. People asked me how I came up with so many ideas to tweet about. The reality is I only tweet about a few ideas, but I use my endless tweet generator to craft those ideas in multiple different ways. Because the secret to being known as an expert is being able to say the same thing over again in multiple different ways.This template follows the exact strategy &amp; process I've used through",
