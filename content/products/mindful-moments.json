    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What's included in the free version vs. premium versions?",
        "answer": "The free version includes the basic Mood Check-In tracker, which is perfect for understanding emotional patterns. Premium versions add Mood & Cycle tracking together, plus dedicated Routines Tracker and Sleep Tracker modules for comprehensive wellness monitoring."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often do I need to check in with the template?",
        "answer": "For best results, quick daily check-ins are recommended - typically just 2-3 minutes to log your mood, any cycle symptoms, routine completion, and sleep data. The template is designed to make this process fast and non-burdensome while still capturing meaningful insights."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I see correlations between my cycle and mood automatically?",
        "answer": "While the template helps you visualize mood and cycle data side by side, you'll identify correlations through reviewing your data patterns over time. The structured tracking makes these connections much more visible than tracking in isolation, though it doesn't auto-generate statistical correlations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for people who don't menstruate?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! While the template includes optional cycle tracking, the core mood, routine, and sleep tracking is valuable for anyone. You can use just the modules that apply to your wellness goals - many users focus solely on mood and sleep without using the cycle features."
