    "overview": "Home OS is a comprehensive household management system built entirely in Notion, designed to bring order, clarity, and coordination to family life and shared living situations. Created by Heyismail, this free template transforms your Notion workspace into a centralized command center for every aspect of home management—from finances and meal planning to maintenance schedules and family events.\n\nThe template features eight interconnected databases that work together to create a complete picture of household operations. Track who lives in your home, manage shared finances, schedule maintenance and repairs, coordinate shopping lists, delegate tasks, inventory important items, remember celebrations, and plan meals—all with intelligent database relations that connect related information automatically.\n\nWith 213 sales and positive user ratings, Home OS has proven particularly valuable for busy families, roommate situations, and anyone managing a household with multiple people and responsibilities. It's the difference between reactive household management (responding to crises) and proactive household management (staying ahead of needs and maintaining smooth operations).",

    "complexityLevel": {
      "rating": 3,

    },
    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How do the database relations work in Home OS?",
        "answer": "The template uses Notion's relational database feature to connect related information. For example, when you add an expense, you can link it to the household member who made the purchase and what it was for. Shopping list items can connect to meal plans and finances, creating an integrated system where information flows between databases."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can this work for roommates or is it only for families?",
        "answer": "Home OS works great for any shared living situation, including roommates, couples, or extended family. The Household Members database can track anyone living in your home, and the task delegation and financial tracking features are valuable for any multi-person household."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do all household members need Notion accounts?",
        "answer": "For collaborative use, household members will need Notion accounts (free accounts work fine). You can share the Home OS workspace with them, allowing everyone to view tasks, add items to shopping lists, and update information. However, one person could also maintain it as the household manager if others prefer not to use Notion."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much time does it take to maintain Home OS weekly?",
        "answer": "After initial setup, maintenance depends on your household complexity. Many users spend 15-30 minutes weekly updating shopping lists, planning meals, and reviewing tasks. The more proactive you are with small updates, the less time you'll spend managing household crises later."
