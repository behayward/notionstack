    "overview": "Gestão de tarefas is a Portuguese-language Notion template designed to simplify task management through a unique 2-in-1 system. The template offers two distinct organizational approaches within a single workspace, allowing users to choose the task management view that best fits their workflow and thinking style.\n\nBuilt specifically for Portuguese-speaking users who struggle with task prioritization, this template includes pre-configured filters and priority systems that help bring clarity to busy task lists. The dual-view approach means you can switch between different organizational methodologies without maintaining separate systems.\n\nThe template is fully customizable and free to use, making it accessible to anyone looking to improve their task management within Notion. Created by Arlaine Braga, it's designed to reduce decision fatigue around task organization and provide clear pathways for execution.",
