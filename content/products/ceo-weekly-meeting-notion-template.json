  "description": "Every week I schedule a CEO Date with myself. This is a non-negotiable time block where I sit down, review my week, and plan the week ahead. It just makes sure that I'm on top of everything and always working in alignment with my goals. If something is off-track or an issue arises, it's much easier to deal with. To save time and ensure I cover all bases, I've created a Notion template with an agenda that I set up as a recurring task each week. I thought I'd share in case it's valuable for you to",
