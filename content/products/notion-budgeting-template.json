      {
        "question": "What exactly is the 50/30/20 rule and why does it work?",
        "answer": "The 50/30/20 rule allocates 50% of your after-tax income to needs (housing, food, utilities), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out, hobbies), and 20% to savings and debt repayment. It works because it's simple enough to follow consistently, balanced enough to allow enjoyment while building security, and flexible enough to adapt to most income levels."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I adjust the percentages if 50/30/20 doesn't fit my situation?",
        "answer": "While the template is built around 50/30/20, you can customize the percentages to match your circumstances. For example, if you live in a high cost-of-living area, you might use 60/20/20. The framework is a guideline, and the template can be adjusted to support whatever allocation works for your situation."

      {
        "question": "Do I need both the Notion and Google Sheets versions?",
        "answer": "No, you get both formats and can choose whichever platform you prefer. Some users prefer Notion for its visual interface and integration with other life management tools, while others prefer Google Sheets for its calculation power and familiarity. Pick the one that fits your workflow best."
