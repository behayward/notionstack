      },
      {
        "question": "Is this secure for storing passwords?",
        "answer": "This template provides organizational convenience within Notion's security framework. Notion uses encryption, but it's not a zero-knowledge encrypted password manager like 1Password or Bitwarden. This template works well for moderate-security accounts (forums, shopping, utilities) but consider dedicated encrypted password managers for highly sensitive accounts (banking, financial, medical). Notion's permissions control who can access your workspace."

        "question": "What are the main use cases for this password manager?",
        "answer": "Primary use cases include organizing passwords for numerous online accounts in one searchable location, generating strong, unique passwords using the built-in widget, assessing current password strength and identifying weak credentials to update, consolidating password management within an existing Notion workspace, tracking account details, security questions, and last password change dates, and maintaining a personal password inventory for accounts that don't require maximum-security password vault encryption."
