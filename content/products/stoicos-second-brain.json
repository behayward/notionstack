    "overview": "StoicOS - Second Brain transforms life management into an epic RPG-style adventure with Stoic philosophy theming. This free template gamifies productivity by turning your goals into quests, building real-life skills that level up, and adding an element of chance with the Fortuna's Favor wheel. It's personal development meets video game mechanics, designed to make self-improvement genuinely engaging rather than another boring to-do list.\n\nWith over 339 sales, StoicOS proves that gamification can motivate sustained engagement with productivity systems. The template integrates task management (called 'Duties'), skill development across multiple life domains (fitness, nutrition, mindfulness, philosophy), project pages, and a quest system that rewards completion with experience points, coins, and Fortuna spins. This neuroscience-backed reward mechanism taps into the same motivation systems that make games addictive, applied to real-life achievement.\n\nBeyond the gamification, StoicOS provides genuinely comprehensive life tracking: workout logging, calorie tracking with recipe database, health metrics from wearables, daily journaling for mood and energy, and integrated note-taking. It's a complete second brain system wrapped in RPG aesthetics that makes grinding through daily responsibilities feel like conquering quests.",
