    "overview": "Notion Task Manager is a free, powerful productivity system built around two proven frameworks: the Eisenhower Matrix for prioritization and Kanban boards for workflow visualization. This template transforms a simple task database into a comprehensive system that helps you not just track tasks, but actually get the right things done.\n\nAt its core is a unified task database that can be viewed through three complementary lenses. The Eisenhower Matrix view helps you prioritize by plotting tasks across importance and urgency, ensuring you focus on what truly matters. The Kanban board provides a visual workflow for tracking progress stages. And the calendar view keeps you aware of all upcoming deadlines, preventing last-minute scrambles.\n\nThe template includes pre-built task templates with built-in guides on how to effectively use the Eisenhower Matrix, making proven productivity frameworks accessible even if you're encountering them for the first time. For anyone feeling overwhelmed by their to-do list or struggling to distinguish between busy work and meaningful progress, this free template provides the structure needed to work smarter, not just harder.",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the Eisenhower Matrix and why should I use it?",
        "answer": "The Eisenhower Matrix is a prioritization framework that categorizes tasks by importance and urgency into four quadrants. It helps you identify which tasks deserve your immediate attention (important and urgent), which should be scheduled (important but not urgent), which can be delegated (urgent but not important), and which should be eliminated (neither). This prevents you from spending all your time on urgent-but-unimportant tasks while neglecting important long-term work."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I decide whether a task is important vs urgent?",
        "answer": "The template includes built-in guidance on this distinction. Generally, important tasks align with your long-term goals and values, while urgent tasks demand immediate attention regardless of their long-term value. An important task might be 'develop quarterly strategy' while an urgent one might be 'respond to non-critical email.' The matrix trains you to recognize this difference over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use just the Kanban board without the Eisenhower Matrix?",
        "answer": "Yes, since all views are based on the same underlying database, you can primarily use whichever view suits your workflow. Some users love the Kanban board for daily workflow and only visit the Eisenhower Matrix weekly for higher-level prioritization. The multiple views give you flexibility rather than forcing you into one method."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this suitable for team task management or just personal use?",
        "answer": "This template is primarily designed for personal task management. While you could share it with team members, it doesn't include collaboration features like task assignment, team workload views, or permission management. For personal productivity and learning proven frameworks, it's excellent; for team project management, you'd want a more collaboration-focused solution."
