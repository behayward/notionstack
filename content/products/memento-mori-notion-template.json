  "description": "I am using Memento Mori as a reminder of how little time I have to live and how much time has already passed away. I use notion for planning my life and having this Memento Mori Calendar right on my notion dashboard has helped me to be more intentional of my time. This has helped me slowly to change my mindset. And I hope it will do the same for you. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There",
