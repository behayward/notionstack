      {
        "question": "How do I get started with this challenge tracker?",
        "answer": "Duplicate the template to your Notion workspace, then add your specific 30-day challenge name and details. The calendar will automatically populate with 30 days from your start date. Each day, simply check in by clicking the daily prompt and marking your practice session complete."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's included in this challenge tracker?",
        "answer": "You get a simple challenge setup interface, daily logging prompts, streak visualization on a calendar view, progress percentage tracking, notes fields for reflections, and a dashboard showing stats across multiple challenges if you use it throughout the year."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I track multiple 30-day challenges at once?",
        "answer": "The Version 1 focuses on tracking a single challenge deeply with maximum simplicity. However, you can duplicate the template for multiple concurrent challenges, or use the year-round version mentioned in the features that supports tracking various challenges you take throughout the entire year."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I miss a day in my challenge?",
        "answer": "The tracker shows you exactly which days you completed and which you missed through the calendar visualization. While missing a day breaks your streak counter, you can still continue the challenge and see your overall completion rate. Many users find that being honest about missed days increases long-term accountability."
