    "overview": "Learn the proven note-taking system of Elizabeth Filips, a medical student and content creator known for her exceptional learning techniques and knowledge retention strategies. This free Notion template captures the exact methodology Elizabeth demonstrates in her popular YouTube video, giving you a ready-made framework for taking book notes that stick. Rather than passively highlighting or creating notes you'll never review, this formula helps you actively engage with material and build a genuine second brain of insights.\n\nThe template implements a specific structure designed to maximize comprehension and long-term retention when reading non-fiction books. Elizabeth's method isn't about capturing every detail—it's about distilling key concepts, making connections to your existing knowledge, and creating actionable takeaways you can actually apply. This approach transforms reading from passive consumption into active learning, ensuring that the time you invest in books actually translates to knowledge you can use.\n\nWhat makes this template valuable despite its simplicity is that it's based on proven cognitive science principles and battle-tested by someone who needs exceptional learning efficiency. Medical students can't afford to read books and forget them—they need retention systems that work. By following Elizabeth's formula, you adopt a framework used by someone who's mastered the art of learning effectively, getting all the benefits of her experience without having to develop the system yourself.",
