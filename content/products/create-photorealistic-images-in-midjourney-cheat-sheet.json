    "overview": "The Midjourney Photorealistic Cheat Sheet is a comprehensive reference guide designed to help AI artists create stunningly realistic images using Midjourney. This paid resource ($9) combines a quick-reference cheat sheet with a detailed Notion document containing over 150 photographic elements, prompt formulas, and technical specifications that elevate AI-generated images from obviously synthetic to convincingly photorealistic.\n\nCreated by Rory Flynn, this template addresses one of the biggest challenges in AI image generation: making outputs look genuinely photographic rather than artificially rendered. The resource breaks down the technical language of photography—camera types, lenses, film stocks, lighting conditions, compositions—and translates them into effective Midjourney prompts.\n\nWith 264 sales, this template has become a go-to resource for AI artists, content creators, and marketers who need photorealistic images for professional projects. It's particularly valuable for users who understand that better prompts yield better results, and who want to move beyond generic AI aesthetics to create images indistinguishable from professional photography.",
