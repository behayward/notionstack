    "overview": "Task Architect is a premium task management system built on the proven Eisenhower Matrix framework, designed to help chronic procrastinators transform into productive achievers. This isn't just another to-do list - it's a complete prioritization system that forces you to categorize every task by urgency and importance, ensuring you always work on what truly matters.\n\nAt $99, this is a professional-grade productivity system for serious users who struggle with prioritization and task overwhelm. The template automates the decision-making process around task management, guiding you through a systematic workflow: upload tasks to a master database, categorize by urgency/importance, then take one of four actions (Do, Delegate, Schedule, or Delete). This structured approach eliminates decision paralysis and helps you focus on high-value work.\n\nUnlike simple task lists, Task Architect provides a complete framework for managing delegation and scheduling, with dedicated dashboards to track tasks you've assigned to others and future-scheduled work. Perfect for managers, entrepreneurs, and anyone drowning in endless to-do lists who needs a battle-tested system to regain control.",
