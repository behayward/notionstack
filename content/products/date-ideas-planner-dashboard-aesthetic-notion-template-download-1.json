    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What exactly is a 'solo date' and why would I plan those?",
        "answer": "A solo date is intentional quality time spent with yourself doing something enjoyable or enriching—like trying a new cafe, visiting a museum, or seeing a movie alone. This template helps you plan and track these self-care experiences just as deliberately as you would dates with others, supporting a healthy relationship with yourself alongside your social connections."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the rating system work?",
        "answer": "After visiting a venue or completing a date idea, you can rate it in the template (typically on a scale you define, like 1-5 stars or similar). You can also add notes about what you loved or didn't enjoy. This builds a personalized database so you can easily reference your top-rated places when planning future dates or making recommendations to friends."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I invite my partner to collaborate without them seeing my solo date plans?",
        "answer": "The template is flexible enough to organize as you prefer. You could create separate databases or categories for solo dates versus partnered dates, then selectively share access to specific sections with your partner. This way you maintain privacy for personal plans while collaborating on shared date planning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there support if I need help customizing the template?",
        "answer": "Yes, the creator offers optional 30-minute coaching calls to help you get the most out of this template. This can be especially helpful if you want to customize the categories, set up collaboration effectively, or integrate the date planner with your existing Notion workspace."
