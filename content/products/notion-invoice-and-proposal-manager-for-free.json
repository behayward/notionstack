    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Can I actually send these invoices to clients, or are they just for tracking?",
        "answer": "You can absolutely send these to clients. The invoice template is designed to be professional and client-ready. You can share the Notion page directly, export as PDF, or copy the content into an email. Many freelancers use these templates as their primary invoicing system, customizing them with their branding and business details."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the pricing calculator work?",
        "answer": "The template includes formula-based fields that automatically calculate line item totals, subtotals, discount amounts, and final totals. You simply enter your service descriptions, quantities, and rates, plus any discount percentage, and the calculator handles all the math. This eliminates manual calculation errors and makes adjusting quotes quick and easy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's included in the monthly and yearly reports?",
        "answer": "The reporting views aggregate your invoice data to show total revenue, number of invoices sent, payment status breakdowns, and trends over time. Monthly reports help you track cash flow, while yearly reports are particularly useful for tax preparation and annual business planning. These are visual database views that update automatically as you add invoices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize the templates with my business branding?",
        "answer": "Yes, both the invoice and proposal templates are fully customizable. You can add your logo, adjust colors, modify field layouts, change terminology, and adapt the structure to match your business needs. The templates are starting points designed to be personalized while maintaining professional presentation."
