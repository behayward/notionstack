    "overview": "The Smart Reading List Template revolutionizes book tracking with a game-changing feature: automatic book metadata filling. Instead of manually entering author names, genres, page counts, and cover images for every book, this template pulls that information automatically, saving you countless hours of tedious data entry while building a comprehensive reading library.\n\nBeyond the autofill capability, this template provides a complete reading ecosystem. Track your annual reading challenge with a visual widget, save highlights and notes in a dedicated database, and organize books through individual author and genre databases for flexible management. Whether you're a casual reader tracking a few books per year or a voracious bibliophile managing hundreds of titles, this template grows with your library while minimizing manual work.",

      {
        "question": "How does the automatic book metadata autofill work?",
        "answer": "The template includes integration with book data sources that automatically populate metadata when you add a book. You typically just need to enter the book title or ISBN, and the system pulls in author, genre, cover image, page count, publication year, and description - saving you from manual data entry."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I track books I'm currently reading vs. already finished?",
        "answer": "Yes, the template includes reading status tracking so you can categorize books as 'To Read', 'Currently Reading', or 'Finished'. This makes it easy to see your active reading list, upcoming books, and completed library all in separate views."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the reading challenge widget work?",
        "answer": "The reading challenge widget lets you set an annual reading goal (e.g., 50 books in 2025) and automatically tracks your progress as you mark books finished. It provides visual motivation showing how close you are to achieving your yearly target."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the advantage of having separate author and genre databases?",
        "answer": "Individual databases for authors and genres give you much more flexibility than simple tags. You can see all books by a specific author, track author details, create genre-based reading lists, and use advanced filtering to discover patterns in your reading preferences. It's especially powerful for large libraries."
