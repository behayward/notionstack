    "overview": "The Wishlist template transforms impulse shopping into intentional purchasing by centralizing all your desired items in one organized digital workspace.

Whether you're saving for big purchases, managing gift ideas, or simply trying to be more mindful about spending, this centralized system helps you prioritize wants versus needs and track items over time before committing to purchase.",

        "question": "Can this template track prices and alert me to sales?",
        "answer": "This template focuses on organizing and tracking items you want rather than monitoring price changes. You'll manually update prices and can note when items go on sale, but it doesn't include automated price tracking or alerts."

      {
        "question": "How does the web clipper integration work?",
        "answer": "The template includes recommendations for web clippers that work with Notion, allowing you to save products from any website directly to your wishlist database. You'll need to set up a compatible web clipper extension separately."

      {
        "question": "Can I share this wishlist with family or friends for gift ideas?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can share your Notion page with others to give them access to your wishlist. This makes it perfect for sharing gift ideas with family members, though the template is designed primarily for personal use rather than collaborative wishlist management."

      {
        "question": "Does this work for both physical products and experiences?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! While designed with shopping in mind, you can use the wishlist database to track any type of desired item or experience - from gadgets and books to concerts, courses, or travel destinations."
