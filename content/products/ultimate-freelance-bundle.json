    "overview": "The Ultimate Freelance Bundle is a complete starter kit for launching and running a successful freelance business, combining four essential resources that would normally cost hundreds of dollars if purchased separately or created from scratch. This free bundle includes an in-depth eBook on landing your first client, a professional Figma proposal template, a Notion invoice template, and a contract template—everything you need to go from aspiring freelancer to earning your first dollar.\n\nEach component addresses a critical pain point in the freelance journey. The eBook provides actionable strategies for finding and closing your first client, the proposal template helps you pitch services professionally, the invoice template streamlines payment collection, and the contract protects you from scope creep and difficult clients. Together, these resources form a complete system for managing freelance client relationships from pitch to payment.\n\nPerfect for aspiring freelancers who are ready to start earning but don't know where to begin, or existing freelancers looking to professionalize their client onboarding process. Instead of cobbling together resources from various sources or learning through expensive mistakes, this bundle provides battle-tested templates and guidance in one package.",
