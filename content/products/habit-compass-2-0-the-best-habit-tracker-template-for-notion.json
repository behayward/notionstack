      {
        "question": "How does the Notion AI habit suggestion feature work?",
        "answer": "The AI analyzes your stated goals and objectives, then suggests habits that research shows are most likely to support those specific outcomes. Instead of generic habit lists, you get personalized recommendations aligned with your unique situation. The AI considers factors like habit stacking opportunities, difficulty progression, and scientific evidence for effectiveness."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes this worth $47 compared to free habit trackers?",
        "answer": "Habit Compass 2.0 combines four specialized tracking systems (main compass, streak tracker, addiction compass, and simple tracker) with AI-powered recommendations, scientifically-backed methodologies, and years of refinement. The one-click button system, flexible tracking options, and comprehensive approach to both building and breaking habits represent a complete behavioral change ecosystem rather than just a tracking tool."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I track both daily and weekly habits in the same system?",
        "answer": "Yes, the template offers immense flexibility with different tracking methodologies. You can track some habits daily (like meditation or exercise) and others weekly (like deep work sessions or relationship check-ins), all within the same system. The tracking method adapts to each habit's natural rhythm rather than forcing everything into the same cadence."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the Addiction Compass differ from the main Habit Compass?",
        "answer": "While the main Habit Compass focuses on building positive habits, the Addiction Compass is specifically designed for breaking unwanted patterns and addictive behaviors. It uses different tracking metrics, provides specialized support for dealing with urges and triggers, and includes frameworks specifically suited to habit elimination rather than habit formation."
