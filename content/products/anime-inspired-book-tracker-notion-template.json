This minimalist, aesthetic Notion template is perfect for anyone seeking a basic library template.This template does not include a daily reading tracker, but you're welcome to add one of your own! If you need help or inspiration, please reach out at 💌 hello@melleesmith.com.I initially made this template for my own use, and since I read a lot of non-fiction, the current shelves are mostly non-fiction genres",
