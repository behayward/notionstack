    "overview": "MUSE is a comprehensive all-in-one Notion dashboard designed to minimize distractions and maximize focus through a unified productivity system. Built by someone who struggled with managing multiple windows and expensive habit tracking apps, this free template consolidates everything you need for reflection, habit tracking, and project management into a single, distraction-free workspace. Instead of juggling between seven different applications, MUSE brings your entire productivity ecosystem into one centralized hub.\n\nThe template features a powerful habit tracker that rivals premium subscription services, project management tools for handling multiple initiatives simultaneously, and dedicated spaces for capturing ideas and reflections. By keeping everything in one place, you eliminate context switching and the mental overhead of managing scattered tools. MUSE is built around the principle that focus comes from simplicity—having one robust system rather than a dozen disconnected apps.\n\nPerfect for easily distracted individuals who value self-improvement and need a single source of truth for their productivity system. The template replaces expensive habit tracking subscriptions while adding project management and reflection capabilities that typically require multiple paid tools.",
