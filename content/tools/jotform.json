    "overview": "JotForm transforms how Notion users collect and process external data by providing a comprehensive form-building platform that seamlessly feeds information into your workspace. Whether you're gathering customer feedback, processing orders, or collecting job applications, JotForm eliminates the manual data entry that typically slows down Notion-based workflows. With its extensive template library and drag-and-drop interface, you can quickly create professional forms that match your brand and business needs.\n\nThe platform excels at handling complex form requirements that go beyond basic data collection. From processing payments through multiple gateways to collecting legally binding e-signatures, JotForm manages the entire customer interaction while automatically updating your Notion databases. This means you can focus on analyzing and acting on the data rather than spending time on manual data transfer.\n\nFor Notion users managing client relationships, events, or business operations, JotForm bridges the gap between external data collection and internal organization. The automated synchronization ensures your Notion workspace stays current with real-time submissions, while advanced features like conditional logic and approval workflows add sophistication to your data collection processes without requiring technical expertise.",

      {
        "question": "How does this integrate with Notion?",
        "answer": "JotForm connects to Notion through Zapier automation. When someone submits a form, Zapier automatically creates or updates records in your specified Notion database, mapping form fields to your database properties."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the setup time?",
        "answer": "Initial form creation takes 15-30 minutes using templates, while setting up the Zapier integration to Notion typically requires another 15-20 minutes. More complex forms with conditional logic may take 1-2 hours to configure properly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a free plan?",
        "answer": "Yes, JotForm offers a free plan that includes up to 5 forms and 100 monthly submissions, which covers basic Notion integration needs. Paid plans start at $34/month for increased submissions and advanced features."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the main use cases for Notion users?",
        "answer": "Popular uses include customer intake forms for service businesses, event registration that populates attendee databases, job application forms for HR workflows, and order forms that integrate with inventory and customer management systems in Notion."
