This means you can focus entirely on creating great content and organizing information in Notion, while Super automatically delivers enterprise-grade website performance with sub-second loading times and professional styling.\n\nFor Notion users who need to share their work publicly - whether it's documentation, portfolios, blogs, or company websites - Super eliminates the traditional barrier between internal knowledge management and external web presence. You get the best of both worlds: Notion's intuitive content creation experience combined with the speed, SEO capabilities, and professional appearance that modern websites demand.",
