    "overview": "Fillout transforms how teams collect and organize data by creating sophisticated forms that seamlessly feed information directly into their Notion databases. Unlike basic form builders, Fillout specializes in complex data collection scenarios where you need advanced logic, calculations, and multi-step workflows that can handle everything from customer intake to quote generation. The platform connects natively with Notion, ensuring that every form submission automatically creates properly formatted database entries without manual data transfer or formatting headaches.\n\nWhat sets Fillout apart is its ability to handle intricate business processes that require conditional branching, real-time calculations, and progressive data collection across multiple pages. Whether you're building a client onboarding sequence that adapts based on user responses or creating dynamic pricing calculators that populate your Notion CRM, Fillout bridges the gap between simple contact forms and enterprise-grade data collection. The result is a streamlined workflow where complex information flows automatically into your Notion workspace, properly categorized and ready for your team to act upon.",
