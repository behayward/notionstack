    "overview": "Potion bridges the gap between Notion's user-friendly content management and professional web development needs. This platform transforms your Notion pages into high-performance websites while preserving the ability to inject custom code for advanced functionality and pixel-perfect designs. Unlike typical Notion website builders that limit customization, Potion maintains the simplicity of managing content in Notion while giving developers and designers complete creative control over the final presentation.\n\nThe tool works by establishing a direct connection to your Notion database, automatically pulling content and converting it into optimized web pages. What sets Potion apart is its dual nature - non-technical users can create beautiful sites using Notion's familiar interface, while developers can enhance these sites with custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve professional-grade results.\n\nFor Notion users who've outgrown basic website builders but want to keep their content workflow in Notion, Potion delivers enterprise-level website performance without sacrificing the content management experience they already know and love.",
