## Data Model

### Product Schema
Each product is stored as an individual JSON file in `/content/products/` following this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "ultimate-notion-dashboard-001",
  "name": "Ultimate Notion Dashboard",
  "slug": "ultimate-notion-dashboard",
  "description": "All-in-one productivity dashboard...",
  "price": 29,
  "currency": "USD",
  "creator": {
    "name": "ProductivityPro",
    "url": "https://gumroad.com/productivitypro"
  },
  "platform": "gumroad",
  "productUrl": "https://productivitypro.gumroad.com/l/dashboard",
  "affiliateUrl": "https://productivitypro.gumroad.com/l/dashboard?a=xxx",
  "category": "template",
  "subcategory": "productivity",
  "tags": ["dashboard", "productivity", "all-in-one"],
  "useCases": ["personal", "business", "students"],
  "hasAffiliate": true,
  "affiliateRate": 30,
  "status": "active",
  "dateAdded": "2024-12-15",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-12-15"
}
```

### Key Fields
- **id:** Unique identifier (used for file naming)
- **slug:** URL-friendly name for page URLs
- **affiliateUrl:** Tracked affiliate link (what CTAs point to)
- **hasAffiliate:** Whether active affiliate relationship exists
- **status:** `active`, `pending` (awaiting affiliate approval), or `inactive`
- **category:** High-level type (template, course, tool, prompts)
- **useCases:** Target audience for filtering

## Content Guidelines

### Product Requirements
- Every product must have a valid JSON file in `/content/products/`
- Use the exact schema structure defined above
- Always include `affiliateUrl` if `hasAffiliate` is true
- Ensure `slug` is unique and URL-safe
- Keep descriptions concise and conversion-focused

### Data Quality Standards
- No duplicate products (check by URL or name before adding)
- All required fields must be present
- Validate URLs are working before committing
- Update `lastUpdated` field when modifying existing products

## Git Workflow

### Commit Guidelines
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Format: `"[Action] Description"` (e.g., "Add 50 new productivity templates")
- Always ask before pushing to main if unsure
- Push to main triggers auto-deploy to production

### Deployment Process
The deployment flow is automatic:
1. Commit changes locally
2. Push to GitHub main branch
3. GitHub triggers Netlify build
4. Netlify rebuilds site and deploys
5. Changes live on notionstack.so within minutes

## Custom Agents

Three custom agents handle different aspects of running NotionStack:

### Scout Agent (`/scouts`)
**Purpose:** Find new Notion products across platforms

**Capabilities:**
- Search Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy, Thrivecart for Notion products
- Check affiliate program availability
- Extract product details (name, creator, price, description)
- Save findings to `/data/scout-results.json`
- Flag products already in database

**Example Usage:**
"Use the scout agent to find 20 new Notion templates on Gumroad that we don't already have."

### Create Agent (`/create`)
**Purpose:** Generate and manage product content files

**Capabilities:**
- Parse Scout results and create product JSON files
- Bulk import from Gumroad export data
- Update existing product information
- Validate data against schema
- Handle duplicate detection

**Example Usage:**
"Use the create agent to import the first 100 products from my Gumroad export file."

### Optimize Agent (`/optimize`)
**Purpose:** Ensure AI-discoverability and content quality

**Capabilities:**
- Generate Schema.org Product markup
- Audit products for missing/incomplete data
- Update metadata for AI crawler compatibility
- Generate optimized sitemaps
- Quality check all product data

**Example Usage:**
"Use the optimize agent to add Schema.org markup to all product pages."

## AI Optimization Strategy

### Structured Data
- All product pages include Schema.org Product markup
- Clean, machine-readable JSON-LD format
- Consistent attribute naming across all products

### Crawler Configuration
- `robots.txt` allows GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot
- Comprehensive sitemap.xml for all product pages
- Clean HTML structure optimized for AI parsing

### User Journey
1. User asks AI: "What's a good Notion template for project management?"
2. AI references NotionStack's structured data
3. User clicks through to product page
4. Clear CTA leads to affiliate link
5. Commission earned on sale

## Starting Assets
- **Domain:** notionstack.so (preserving existing authority)
- **Product Database:** ~5,000 products from Gumroad affiliate history
- **Existing Relationships:** Various affiliate programs already established

## Success Metrics

### 6-Month Targets
- **Product Pages:** 5,000+
- **Monthly Visitors:** 2,000+
- **Annual Revenue:** $2,000+
- **Active Affiliates:** 500+
- **Weekly Maintenance:** <1 hour

### Decision Framework (6-Month Review)
**Double Down If:**
- Revenue exceeds $1,500/year run rate
- Traffic growing month-over-month
- AI discovery showing positive signals
- Maintenance remains low

**Pivot or Sunset If:**
- Revenue flat despite large catalog
- No evidence of AI-driven traffic
- Maintenance becomes burdensome

## Common Tasks

### Add New Products
"Import the next 100 products from /data/gumroad-export.csv and create JSON files for them."

### Update Products
"Update the affiliate URL for product [slug] to [new URL]."

### Deploy Changes
"Commit all changes with message '[description]' and push to GitHub."

### Quality Audit
"Use the optimize agent to audit all products and flag any with missing required fields."

### Site Status Check
"Check if the Netlify deploy completed successfully and the site is live."

## Weekly Maintenance Routine
1. Use scout agent to find 20 new products
2. Use create agent to add quality products from scout results
3. Update any affiliate links that need attention
4. Commit and push changes
5. Review affiliate applications requiring manual action

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Basic site structure with 50 test products
- Git workflow established
- Auto-deployment working

### Phase 2: Data Import (Week 3-4)
- Import full 5k product database
- Build filtering and search
- Data quality audit

### Phase 3: Affiliate Integration (Week 5-6)
- Ensure 80%+ products have working affiliate links
- Implement tracking and CTAs
- Test revenue flow

### Phase 4: AI Optimization (Week 7-8)
- Add Schema.org markup
- Configure crawler access
- Test AI assistant discovery

### Phase 5: Automation (Week 9-12)
- Establish maintenance routines
- Monitor performance
- Evaluate and iterate

## Important Notes

### File Operations
- Always validate JSON syntax before committing
- Check for duplicates before adding new products
- Update `lastUpdated` timestamp on modifications
- Maintain consistent naming conventions for product IDs

### Code Quality
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Optimize for build speed (large catalog)
- Ensure pages load fast (<2s)
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Affiliate Best Practices
- Test affiliate links before publishing
- Use UTM parameters for tracking
- Respect platform terms of service
- Update broken links promptly
