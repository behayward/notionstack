## Deferred Categories (Hold Off)

These categories are **less Notion-specific** and can wait:

### ❌ Cloud Storage & File Integration
**Why Defer:** Generic tools, not Notion-specific
- Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, OneDrive
- Low affiliate potential
- Users already know these tools

### ❌ Visualization & Design (7 tools)
**Why Defer:** Used WITH Notion, not FOR Notion
- Canva, Figma, Miro, Whimsical, Lucidchart, Excalidraw, draw.io
- Not Notion integrations per se
- Generic design tools

### ❌ Communication & Messaging (6 tools)
**Why Defer:** Adjacent tools, not core Notion functionality
- Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Loom, Twist, Telegram
- Users already have these
- Low relevance to Notion-specific directory

### ❌ AI & Content Generation (8 tools)
**Why Defer:** Emerging category, unclear affiliate landscape
- ChatGPT, Notion AI, Copy.ai, Jasper, etc.
- Rapidly changing market
- Wait to see which tools gain traction

### ❌ Collaboration & Project Management (10 tools)
**Why Defer:** Notion competitors, not complements
- ClickUp, Asana, Monday.com, Trello, etc.
- Counterproductive to promote Notion alternatives
- Low conversion potential
